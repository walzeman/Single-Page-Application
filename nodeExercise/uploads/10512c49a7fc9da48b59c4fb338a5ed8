	OO Principles
		Encapsulate what varies
		Favor composition over inheritance
		Program to Interfaces, not implementations
	OO Patterns
		Strategy - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, 				and makes them interchangeable. Strateg lets the algorithm 				vary independently from clients that use it.
		The Observer Pattern - defines a one to many dependency between 			objects so that when one object changes state, all of its 				dependents are notified and updated automatically.
